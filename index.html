    <p class="myP" >As a student of Business Administration with a specialization in Management Information Systems at The Ohio State University, I am immersed in the dynamic intersection of business and technology. My academic focus centers on leveraging new technologies to enhance operational efficiency and strategic outcomes for businesses.

      Currently pursuing my bachelors degree from the Max M. Fisher College of Business, my professional trajectory encompasses diverse roles as a shift manager, marketing intern, product marketer, marketing researcher, operational designer, and research assistant. These experiences have enhanced my commitment to achieving excellence in every professional endeavor.
      
      Committed to continuous growth, I participated in the Media, Marketing, and Communications Scholars Program, refining my skills through targeted classes. Proficient in tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Tableau, WordPress, and Qualtrics, I am well-equipped to navigate the technological landscape that defines today's business environment.
      
      Looking ahead, my professional aspirations include cultivating relationships with industry professionals and mastering a diverse array of technological programs. Concurrently, my personal goals align with expanding my knowledge in areas that fuel my passions, namely sustainability, diversity, and technology.
      
      I engage with varied perspectives and experiences, evident in my commitment to reading literature that complements my coursework. Notable reads include "The Black Swan" by Nassim Taleb, "Cradle to Cradle" by Michael Braungart and William McDonough, "The Innovator's Dilemma" by Clayton Christensen, and "A Thousand Brains" by Jeff Hawkins. I welcome recommendations and am always eager for insightful conversations.
      
      I am always looking for ways to better myself personally, professionally, and academically. Feel free to contact me via email: hoch.55@buckeyemail.osu.edu with questions or comments. </p>
